â€”-OVERVIEW--

This package is a collection of top down spacecraft assets to use in your games. It includes a variety of colors as well as separate outline, shading, and block shading layers for editing.

--EDITING INSTRUCTIONS--

Import editing layers as separate layers in editing program. To re-color, use an additional layer using a multiply blend mode. 

If the sprites are looking blurry, check your programs interpolation setting which sometimes causes smooth transitions between pixels(which are not wanted in this case).
